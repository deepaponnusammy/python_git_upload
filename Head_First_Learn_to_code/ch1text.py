text = """ The first thing that stands between you and writing your first
real piece of code is learning the skill of breaking problems
down into achievable little actions that a computer can do for
you. Of course, you and the computer will also need to be
speaking a common language, but we’ll get to that topic in
just a bit.

Now breaking problems down into a number of steps may
sound like a new skill, but it’s actually something you do
every day. Let’s look at a simple example: say you wanted
to break the activity of fishing down into a simple set of
instructions that you could hand to a robot, who would do
your fishing for you. Here’s our first attempt to do that:

You can think of these statements as a nice recipe for fishing.
Like any recipe, this one provides a set of steps that, when
followed in order, will produce some result or outcome (in our
case, hopefully, catching some fish).

Notice that most steps consist of a simple instruction, like
“cast line into pond,” or “pull in the fish.” But also notice that
other instructions are a bit different because they depend
on a condition, like “is the bobber above or below water?”
Instructions might also direct the flow of the recipe, like “if
you haven’t finished fishing, then cycle back to the beginning
and put another worm on the hook.” Or, how about a
condition for stopping, as in “if you’re done, then go home”?

You’re going to find that these simple statements or
instructions are the foundation of coding. In fact, every app
or software program you’ve ever used has been nothing more
than a (sometimes large) set of simple instructions to the
computer that tell it what to do.

Actually, a recipe is a perfectly good way
to describe a set of instructions to a computer. You might
even run into that term loosely used here and there in
more advanced programming books. Heck, you’ll even
find books on common software development techniques
that are called cookbooks. That said, if you want to
get technical we can—a computer scientist or serious
software developer would commonly call a recipe an
algorithm. What’s an algorithm? Well, not much more
than a recipe—it’s a sequence of instructions that solves
some problem. Often you’ll find algorithms are first
written in an informal form of code called pseudocode."""
